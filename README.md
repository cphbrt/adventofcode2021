# Advent of Code 2021

How to use my solutions:
```sh
cat sample | java One.java
```

Output is written to stdout.

For old time's sake, in memory of the good ole' days,
the Mid-Central USA Regional Contest of ICPC,
I'm doing this
~~(as of day 2)~~
(as of day 4)
with just
~~ViM (no features, even syntax coloring disabled)~~
VS Code (syntax highlighting but no Java extensions)
and my memory of the basic Java primitives.

No Kubernetes. No Spark. No Hadoop.

Just... `int`s, `String`s, `while` loops... ahh...

`while(true);`
